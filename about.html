      <h3>The Xfinity Idea</h3>
      <h4>Ellis Wright</h4>
      <p>(2021-) After landing her first internship as a web development intern, Ellis thought she had 6 months to build her dev portfolio and secure a full-time job. But in a sudden turn of events, a dream opportunity opens up before she has the chance. How will she show Comcast that she has the skills and competencies of a Jr. Front End Developer without any completed projects under her belt?</p>

      <p>As the first in my family attend to a 4-year college, and the second from my town to obtain an Ivy League Bachelor's degree, my adult life has been defined by achieving success without having a clear direction to follow. I refuse to define my ambitions around what's familiar, and as a result I am resourceful, adaptable, and a person with limitless potential on what I can learn.
        <p>This is the basis for how I started this project: committing myself to an end result that extended my current skillset, and using every available resource to see it through. One week later, and I have not only the web application I aimed to build, but also a newfound understanding of Javascript that I can use in the future.</p>
        <p>That said, as a Jr. Front End Developer, I can offer Comcast an unwavering enthusiasm for learning and a commitment to raising the bar. I can offer the Xfinity team someone who thrives on the challenge and excitement that comes with coding, from ideation to testing to debugging. And I can't think of a better place to start my career than at a company where innovation is the standard.</p>
